Summary:
Went through examples on website, downloading programs as I Went.

Set up account on Github.

Downloaded Atom - Have used Python before - seems very similar, but with more options.

Downloaded Sourcetree : Windows 10 - Program kept freezing up, spent many hours trying
to get the program to work. Rebooting etc.

Downloaded GitHub Desktop to see if it would work better than Sourcetree.
So far Github still freezes but not as bad as Sourcetree.
